         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Bloud Expiated by Juſtice:</hi> OR, The Execution of the Two Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers in Fleetſtreet.</head>
            <p>THere having formerly been ſome brief Account given of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in print, in the Tranſactions of the laſt Seſſions, I ſhall not ſtand tediouſly to repeat all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or concomitant Circumſtances, upon what occaſions and provocations, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, the murther came to be committed for which theſe perſons now ſuffered. The ſum and effect of their Crime being thus, as it appeared at their Tryal.</p>
            <p>This Knight and a friend of his were in Company together at a Tavern in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> but they had not long been there before, two perſons intruded into their Company; one of which preſently falls a quarrelling with the Knights Friend, upon the account of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings that he pretended was owing to him by his Brother, as won of him at play;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171630:3"/>and he would have it of him; which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and thereupon from words they fell to blows, but at length were parted; but not being ſatisfi'd, they were reſolved to waylay them, where they might have a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to accompliſh their Bloody deſigns; and following them towards the back gate of the Temple, neer <hi>White fryers,</hi> both of them moſt barbarouſly fell upon the Knight, thruſting both their Swords into his Body, before he could draw his Sword: all which being proved by ſufficient Evidence, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brought them in both guilty of Murther.</p>
            <p>After this, having nothing material to ſay for themſelves, ſave only ſome frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretences that the Knight's Sword was drawn (the contrary whereof was proved) and that they killed him fairly (as they call'd it). The Court proceeded to Paſs Sentence of Death againſt them, and they were remanded back to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
            <p>The time of their Execution was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till <hi>Friday</hi> the two and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> and the place appointed for it was in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> over againſt <hi>White-fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> the place where they did the Fact.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171630:3"/>
            <p> During the time of their continuance in Newgate in expectation of death, they were viſited by ſeveral Miniſters, who with the moſt preſſing and pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations endeavoured to make them ſenſible of their Crimes and Condition; adviſing them to repent, ſince it was high time, they being upon the very Brink of Eternity.</p>
            <p>They remembred them of the ſad ſtate they were in, as being doom'd by Juſtice to a certain death, and that for the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scarlet-ſin of Murther; that in their condition they could not expect any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on earth, nor any pardon but from the King of Heaven; but told them, though it were vain for them to flatter themſelves with hopes of longer life in this world, yet there was means left to ſecure them of everlaſting life in the next: that to ſuch ſinful Wretches as they had been, it was an unſpeakable Mercie, that they had yet a little ſpace left wherein to make their peace with Heaven. Oh what would the
<pb facs="tcp:171630:4"/>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:171630:4"/>damned Souls, weltering without hope in eternal Flames, give for ſuch a precious opportunity? That they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mortal Wounds at the time when they did the Act, and been ſnatcht away ſuddenly with all the ſtains of Blood and Murther upon their guilty Souls; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now they had leaſure and opportunity if they would lay hold of it, to waſh them off with true penitential Tears, and the Blood of their Crucified Redeemer applied by Faith.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like pious Exhortations they heard and received with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet ſtill endeavoured to excuſe themſelves, that they had no intent to murther the Gentleman, and that it was an unhappy Accident done in heat and paſſion, rather by miſchance than preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated malice: But to this it was replied, That that very Paſſion was a ſin, and the ſad effects of it a far greater: that by God's own Law, he that killed a man by miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture was not held innocent; How
<pb facs="tcp:171630:5"/>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:171630:5"/>much leſs they who had taken away a Worthy perſons life voluntarily, and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as appeared by the Circumſtances, upon deliberation? To all which they had little to anſwer, but their former pretences to extenuate their Crime, For which they profeſſed themſelves heartily ſorry, and begged forgiveneſs of God and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Relations for the ſame.</p>
            <p>For their Execution, two Gibbets were ſet up in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> one at the great Gate going into <hi>White-fryers,</hi> the other at the leſſer Paſſage down thither, by the Green-Dragon Tavern.</p>
            <p>When the Priſoners were brought thither, neither of them ſaid much, but ſtill inſiſted upon their having no Murtherous deſigne when they committed the fact. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they had led very vain and bad Lives, and that it was juſt with God to bring them to this ſhameful death. And deſired all perſons to beware of Gaming, and profaning the Sabbath, and of Ill Company; which bring ſo many to ruine and deſtruction.</p>
